## Overview
The News Room is an 8 hour take-home coding challenge which consumes the New York Times Top Stories API. It provides the user on page load with a list of articles, an ability to click on one specific article which then can lead the user to a link for the full article, and a search functionality. The purpose of this project was to utilize best practies while prioritizing an MVP within the timeframe.
